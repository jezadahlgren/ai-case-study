# AMP Robotics Case Study 

## Overview and Origin

Background:
AMP Robotics is a midsize company located in Louisville, Colorado. It was founded in 2014 by Dr. Matanya Horowitz (CEO) who even at a young age was fascinated by robotics. Dr. Horowitz earned four bachelor's degrees (electrical engineering, computer science, applied mathematics, and economics), a masters (electrical engineering) before completing his doctorate in Controls and Dynamic Systems at Caltech.  

After his schooling he began looking for areas where he could combine technology and his childhood love of robotics which led him to recycling.  At this time there were limited companies working on how to better the recycling process and it was intensely manual and wasteful. Dr. Horowitz merged machine learning techniques with robotics to create a more automated system that would reduce labor and cost with a consistent solution of identification of products to be recycled.  These became the bedrock of AMPs product offerings an AI platform AMP Neuron™; robotics system AMP Cortex™, which “automates the high-speed identification, sorting, picking, and processing of material streams.”

AMP Robotics received early-stage grant funding and partnership from Carton Council and Denver’s Alpine Waste and Recycle (now GFL Environmental) to test and develop the initial robot prototypes.  After these initial first steps the company started to grow from ten employees to over 200 who work at AMP Robotics today.  AMP Robotics raised Series A funding ($16 million) in 2019, Series B funding ($55 million) in 2020, and in 2022 secured $91 million Series C with the goal of scaling the organization to meet global demand currently. According to CB Insights AMP Robotics has raised over $176.58 million with 17 investors.  


## Business Activities

Although the current recycling rates have increased from less than 7% in 1960 to just 32% in 2022 this continues to be an area of opportunity for the United States.  In fact, according to Dumpsters.com. a blog, the overall recycling rate in the United States has dropped between 2017 to current.  The amounts of waste produced by Americans continues to increase during this same time span and according to the EPA recycling and reuse activities account for $37.8 billion in wages and 681,000 jobs in the United States alone.  

Not only is additional waste being produced year-over-year, in 2018 the Chinese government banned the import of 24 different recyclables (including paper and plastics).  This reduction of exports of recycling waste to China meant that the U.S. had to discover other areas to ship it’s recycling waste. In a report from The Guardian, in 2019, found that the U.S. ships hundreds of thousands of plastic waste every year to poorly regulated developing countries around the world rather than utilizing the current labor-intensive recycling process.  AMP Robotics would enable a faster way to identify paper and plastic waste by utilizing its proprietary mix of Artificial Intelligence, machine learning and robotics to reduce the labor-intensive process.  

The current products for AMP Robotics incorporate robotics along with machine learning and AI algorithms will help to quickly identify and augment the plastic detection manual process.  

AMP CORTEX™ is AMP Robotics flagship product utilizing neural networks to identify shapes and materials to create the largest data set of images to be used in machine learning algorithms that currently achieve up to 99% accuracy and up to 80 - 120 picks per minute.

AMP Vision allows the quality control of all of the recycling material that flows through the line by a modular computer vision system. 
AMP Clarity is a robotic performance software solution that incorporates mass estimation, status tracking and alerts, as well as robot pick assignment all real-time.  

According to Waste Management World: 

Can you describe how the technology works?
There are three components of our system, and you can think of them as the eyes, the brain, and the arms. Cameras, the eyes, record material as it comes down a conveyor to be picked and sorted. The brain, which is the AI, converts these video camera images into data, capturing and categorizing everything it recognizes. Then, software guides the robotic “arms” to pick and place the material to be recovered. All of this happens at superhuman speed with consistent precision and extremely high accuracy.

How maintenance-intensive is this technology?
As with any equipment, AMP systems require periodic maintenance inclusive of quick change-out of consumable parts, routine inspection, and preventive maintenance for wear parts. Maintenance activities are short with remote support available from AMP’s service team and tooling provided to assist with maintenance activities.

What sets AMP Robotics technology apart from others?
Our proprietary AI platform, AMP Neuron, recognizes more than 50 billion objects on an annual basis—a number that continues to exponentially increase as our install base expands. We’ve seen the most materials, in more permutations. AI accuracy and performance is built on training a platform on as much data as possible. As our fleet of automation continuously grows across the globe, our AI exponentially increases its ability to learn from data collected from different locations, growing smarter and more effective every day. A robot in a UK sorting facility is helping robots in the U.S., Spain, or any other location improve their ability to identify items that can be recycled.


## Landscape

Although this field has exploded in the last decade, currently the U.S. has been slow to adopt the recycling habit.  The ability to create methods that allow companies to identify and create solutions to a greener method of consumption will only help the sustainability of our planet.  Other companies attempting to help include: 
“BANQloop is a US-based startup that develops an eponymous smart waste management platform. The startup deploys its smart trash units, banQx1, or its heavy-duty variant, banQx1.HD, at waste generation sites. They use AI-driven robotics to sort wastes at the source. The startup’s mobile smart trash unit, banQx1.HDm, also provides household waste pick-up services.  BANQloop’s intelligence platform, loopiQ, then provides material analysis data, pick-up notifications, and green scores. Government institutions and businesses leverage these solutions to increase recycling rates and optimize waste logistics.”  (Retrieved October, 29, 2023. https://www.startus-insights.com/innovators-guide/recycling-technology-trends-innovation/#:~:text=Advanced%20recycling%20technologies%20have%20the,bacteria%20to%20tackle%20plastic%20waste)

BicyCompost is a French startup that provides bio-waste valorization. The startup collects organic waste using electric bikes and naturally composts it. BicyCompost then distributes the compost, free of charge, to its partner farmers, promoting local agriculture. This allows food businesses to ensure sustainable management of the waste they generate. .”  (Retrieved October, 29, 2023. https://www.startus-insights.com/innovators-guide/recycling-technology-trends-innovation/#:~:text=Advanced%20recycling%20technologies%20have%20the,bacteria%20to%20tackle%20plastic%20waste)


## Results

Currently AMP Robotics has over 80 different sorting facilities and approximately 230 deployments of its AMP Cortex robotic sorting systems.  In the upcoming years it is thought that AMP Robotics can tap into the nearly $200 billion market for non-recyclable materials.  In 2022, the EPA funded a pilot program for clean robotics to start to test AI-guided research to reduce unwanted waste pollution.  In order to monitor these changes core metrics should include items such a accuracy of the model, amount of waste exported outside of the U.S. as well as totality of clean energy created by the holistic process (is recycling generated additional pollution to counteract the amount of pollution it should be reducing).  

## Recommendations

Personally, I think that AMP Robotics taps into human nature in that the U.S. is inherently slow to adopt new processes making the act of recycling difficult.  Americans are not always placing material in the correct locations for recycling in general (I know I might not be the best at this and I TRY!).  However, by taking out the human element and sorting materials prior to landfill AMP Robotics increase the likelihood of waste exports and landfill accumulation.  I think that AMP Robotic should partner with some of the bio-solutions to break down the material that it identifies.  This partnership would allow for the full turnover of waste into a net zero waste process.
